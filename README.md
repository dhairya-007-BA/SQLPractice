SQL Practice Project — Customer & Order Analysis:
This project is a simple SQL practice environment I built using SQLite and VS Code.
It uses two small datasets — customers and orders — to explore how relational databases work and how SQL queries can answer real business questions.

💡 Project Overview:
I created this project to strengthen my understanding of SQL fundamentals used in data analytics and business intelligence.
Through this dataset, I practiced joining tables, aggregating data, and finding insights such as top customers, average order amounts, and country-level sales.

📘 Datasets:
Customers – contains basic customer details (name, city, country, age).
Orders – contains order transactions linked to each customer (order date, amount).

🧠 Example Queries:
Find all customers from Canada
Show each customer’s name with their total order amount
Find the top 3 customers by total spending
Calculate the average order amount by country
Identify customers who haven’t placed any orders

⚙️ Tools Used:
SQLite
VS Code + SQLTools extension
GitHub for version control

✍️ What I Learned:
How to join related tables using primary/foreign keys
How to summarize and group data using SUM() and GROUP BY
How to write clean, reusable SQL queries in VS Code
