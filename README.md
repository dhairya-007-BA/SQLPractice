LEVEL 2 — JOINS (Linking Data Together)
You’ll practice JOINs, which analysts use every day.
Practice Questions
Show each customer’s name with their total order amount.
List all orders along with the customer’s city and country.
Find customers who haven’t made any orders yet.
Get the total revenue per country.
For each customer, show their latest order date.
💡 Tip: Practice both INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN — explain when each is useful.

📊 LEVEL 3 — AGGREGATION & GROUPING
Now you summarize data — a key skill for dashboards.
Practice Questions
Calculate total revenue, average order value, and number of orders.
Find the city with the highest average order amount.
Count how many customers are older than 30 per country.
Find the top 3 customers by total spending.
Show the month-wise total revenue for 2023.
💡 Hint: Use SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), GROUP BY, and ORDER BY.

🧩 LEVEL 4 — SUBQUERIES & CASE STATEMENTS
These are used for deeper logic or reporting conditions.
Practice Questions
Find customers whose total spending is above average.
Write a query that classifies customers:
“High Value” if total > $500
“Medium Value” if total between $200–$500
“Low Value” otherwise
Find the second-highest order amount.
Show customers who made more than 2 orders.
Get total spending per country but only include those above $500 total.

🧠 LEVEL 5 — ANALYTICAL FUNCTIONS (Intermediate)
Once you’re comfy, start using window functions — this makes your SQL look pro-level 👇
Practice Questions
Rank customers by their total spending using RANK() or DENSE_RANK().
Calculate a running total of revenue ordered by date.
Show month-over-month growth in revenue.
Find the difference between each customer’s order and their average order value.
Find each customer’s first and last purchase dates.
